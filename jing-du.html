<li>Let&#8217;me relax for a while, I <em>have just played</em> a soccer&nbsp;game.</li>
<li>Give me the computer so I could finish this movie, I <em>have seen</em> the first half of it this&nbsp;afternoon. </li>

<li>Reading the textbook <em>throughly</em> doesn&#8217;t necesarrily mean you can get a high&nbsp;score.</li>

<li>I have to <strong>inform</strong> the House that I was mistaken in my original perceptions, and that I have now <strong>taken a rather different view</strong><ul>
<li>Inform sb sth<ol>
<li>Stop doing this, I&#8217;m <em>informing</em> you that you are commiting&nbsp;crime</li>

<li>Give yourself a chance, <em>shed your tragic past</em> and start a new&nbsp;life</li>
