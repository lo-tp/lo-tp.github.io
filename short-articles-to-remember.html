<h3>Why I Love&nbsp;Vim</h3>
<p>Firstly, let&#8217;s talk about another question: what do you think about developers?
Well, developers are lazy and clever at the same time. They often spend <strong>a large quantity</strong> of time thinking how to automate repetitive tasks so they can get more time to make innovations, such as pondering over the software design or doing refactoring. They don&#8217;t want to repeat themselves over and over again; they always try to make things with as less effort as possible to get as much things as possible done. They don&#8217;t want to waste time; they want to be productive. <code>Vim is the best way for you to accomplish all these targets.</code></p>
<p><strong>Basically</strong>, vim is a text editor. But vim is <strong>much more</strong> than that. With vim, you can do almost everything for developing. No matter you are a frontend or a backend developer, you can always use vim to do your job. With vim, debuggers and version control system clients etc all suddenly become unnecessary; you can integrate them all  with vim at&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>Vim can help you work more <strong>smoothly and effectively</strong>. You can move your cursors between lines with just a few keystrokes, customize the entire editor so it <strong>fits your preferences best</strong> and do complex operations in the most effecient way <strong>with the help of</strong> all kinds of vim plugins. Embracing vim, you&#8217;ll <strong>be given the gift</strong> of <strong>making more progress in shorter times</strong>.</p>
<p>I think you know that there&#8217;re so many people who have to work remotely through slow network connections to do their jobs on different computers. For them, vim is <strong>godsend</strong>. At first, vim is light weight and adequate of working in bad connections. And secondly vim is <strong>ubiquitous</strong>, you can find vim in almost every computer running Linux. Last but most significantly, vim can <strong>provide you with</strong> a <strong>unified experience</strong> in editing. You can easily configure vim in the remote computer to make it <strong>behave exactly as</strong> the one on your computer by just uploading one small&nbsp;file. </p>
<p>Now you&#8217;ve <strong>appreciated</strong> the magic of vim, but as you know <strong>there is no such thing as a free lunch</strong>. Before <strong>puttering cozily</strong> around in the vim world, you have to <strong>totally exert yourself</strong> to <strong>get command of</strong> vim for the <strong>learning curve</strong> of vim is <strong>formidable</strong>. Believe me, it&#8217;s&nbsp;worth. </p>
